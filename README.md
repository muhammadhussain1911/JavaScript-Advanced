# 🚀 Advanced JavaScript Learning & Projects

Welcome to my **Advanced JavaScript Practice Repository**, where I document my deep dive into the core and advanced concepts of JavaScript. This repo is a result of disciplined learning, project implementation, and hands-on experimentation. It showcases my journey through topics that are often asked in interviews and used in real-world development.

## 📁 Real-World Project Practice

These folders are self-contained mini-projects:
- ✅ **BMI Calculator**
- ✅ **Digital Clock**
- ✅ **Color Picker**
- ✅ **Color Changer**
- ✅ **Password Generator**

Each one reflects practical use of JS concepts like DOM, Events, Math, and Timing APIs.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- HTML5
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Modern JS features (OOP, Classes, Prototypes, Events)
- Browser APIs (DOM, BOM, Timing APIs)

## 🧠 Why This Repo Matters

This repository is not just a collection of notes or copied tutorials. Every file, every folder represents a step toward:
- **Becoming job-ready**
- **Mastering real-world JavaScript**
- **Understanding the internals (like V8 engine, `this`, bind, etc.) (closures coming soon)**
- **Solving interview-level problems confidently**

## 🧑‍💻 My Learning Method

> ✅ Watched 30+ hours of YouTube content from top educators  
> ✅ Practiced and rewrote concepts in my own words  
> ✅ Asked deep technical questions from ChatGPT to understand internals  
> ✅ Built mini-projects from scratch to reinforce learning
> ✅ In my files, I comment on many lines of code. Don't think them useless. Uncomment them and see their functionality.
